# BloxdInGameDebugger

Bloxd In-Game Debugger (Codenamed Stardue Debugger) is designed to allow users to debug their code easily and to find bugs more easily in bloxd.io

## Usage

As described in this Youtube [video](https://youtu.be/jKbtv7DhAsQ).

Copy worldcode_mini.js to world code.

To use the example, copy codeblock.js to a code block and run the code block.

## FILES

### worldcode_og.js

This is the original code written by Chestplate and Gemini 3 Pro Preview

### worldcode_mini.js

This is a mangled + minified code translated from worldcode_og.js via the model Gemini 2.5 Pro (I ran out of credits on Gemini 3 Pro Preview). Use this in actuall production since it takes up less characters.
